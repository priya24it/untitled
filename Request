Hi, this is Prius. As my current project is nearing its end, I wanted to reach out to check if there are any openings available. I am currently exploring opportunities, particularly in Python test automation or ETL testing roles. Please let me know if there are any relevant positions that I could consider.

This version maintains the intent while making it more polished and professional. Let me know if you need any further tweaks!
